I. Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may ask yourself: What is InDE? 
We often call it "a fast and pragmatic C/C++ IDE". This means InDE is a program
which you can use to write software. There are tons of useful features which 
make developing fun:

	<list of features>
	
<note on platform independent software development with SCons>



II. Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You at least need:

	- Python >= 2.3
	- SCons >= 0.93
	- FOX >= 1.5.0



III. Getting InDE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many ways to get InDE packages for your machine. The most common way
is to visit our website at http://inde.berlios.de/ and download the latest
stable (or development) release.

If you use Linux, your distribution might already offer pre-compiled InDE 
packages.

Another way is to get our daily development snapshot at:
	
	http://inde.berlios.de/download/inde-snapshot.tar.bz2

Finally, you can checkout the current Subversion tree by using the SVN command
line client:

	svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/projects/inde/trunk



IV. Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After downloading the latest release or our daily development snapshot 
from our website you will have to unpack and change to the directory
you unpacked the archive at first:

	tar xvjf <archive name>.tar.bz2
	cd <archive name>/

If you checked out the source from our SVN tree, go to the directory inde/trunk
if you are not already in it.

After this, every method will build and install using the same instructions, 
that are:
	
	scons				-	Compiling
	scons -c			-	Cleaning up the build
	scons install		-	Install InDE
	scons -c install	-	Uninstall InDE
	scons docs			-	Make docs (they can be found in doc/)
	
You can get more information about available commands and parameters using

	scons --help
	
	

V. Getting started
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While you are reading this README we probably might have created some 
documentation for InDE already. You can read them by opening

	docs/index.html
	
with a web browser of your choice. They are mostly validated XHTML documents so
you can view them even with a text browser like Lynx.



VI. Help and Support
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you run into problems or like to see new features getting integrated into
InDE, feel free to join the InDE-users mailinglist at:

	<mailing-list url>

If you think you have found a bug, see next section for instructions on how to 
let us now about them.

Please let us know if you are using InDE for developing a certain software. 
This way we can support you by an entry in the "Projects" list on our website.


VII. Bug reports
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can report bugs either by posting them at

	<bug-tracker url>

or joining the InDE-devel mailinglist at

	<mailing-list url>



VIII. Joining development
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many ways to contribute to InDE:
	
	- Translating InDE into another language
	- Taking part in discussions on the InDE-devel mailinglist 
	- Taking over maintenance for InDE packages for your Linux/BSD distribution
	
	<list of other possibilities>
